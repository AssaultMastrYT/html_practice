            Crocodile
        </summary>
        <p>
            Crocodiles (family Crocodylidae) or true crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the
            tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. The term crocodile is sometimes used even more loosely
            to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes the alligators and caimans (family
            Alligatoridae), the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae) among other extinct taxa.

        <summary>Monkey</summary>
        <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the
            simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the
            apes, which constitutes an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however, in the broader sense based on
            cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regards to
            their scope.</p>
